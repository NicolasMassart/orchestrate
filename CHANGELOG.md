* Issue with transaction in RECOVERING status 

## v2.3.0-rc1 (2020-07-29)

### ðŸ†• Features
* Add the new `tx-scheduler` API microservice. The new API:
  * replaces the `envelope-store` and serves the same internal purpose
  * is the new API that is used to POST every transactions (they are no longer sent on the tx-crafter Kafka topic).
    * POST `/transactions/deploy-contract`: Creates and sends a new contract deployment. Supports one-time key & private transactions.
    * POST `â€‹/transactionsâ€‹/send`: Creates and sends a new contract transaction. Supports one-time key & private transactions.
    * POST `/transactionsâ€‹/send-raw`: Creates and sends a raw transaction
    * POST â€‹`/transactionsâ€‹/transfer`: Creates and sends a transfer transaction
  * exposes GET endpoints to fetch transaction details
    * GET â€‹`/transactions`: Search transaction requests by provided filters
    * GET `â€‹/transactionsâ€‹/{uuid}`: Fetch a transaction request by uuid
* Added support for Transaction priority. Users can now specify the gas priority of the transaction (`very-high`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `very-low`), the transaction Gas Price will be adjusted automatically based on network activity.
* Update internal logger to follow [Elastic Common Schema](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html) when using logs in JSON format

### ðŸ†• Chain-registry and tx-listener
* Add the chain-registry microservice that:
    * Serves an API to store a list of ethereum chains with their configurations (URLs, tenantID, name, block depth, block position, backoff duration). The API allows to dynamically update chains configuration instead of passing them in environment variable.
        * GET `/chains`: get the list of chains registered
        * GET `/chains/{uuid}`: get the chain configuration given by the {uuid}
        * GET `/chains/{tenantID}`: get the list of chains registered for a given {tenantID}

        * POST `/chains/{tenantID}`: create a new chain for a given {tenantID}
        * PATCH `/chains/{uuid}`: modify the chain configuration for a given {uuid}
        * PATCH `/chains/{tenantID}/{name}`: modify the chain configuration for a given {tenantID} and {name}

        * DELETE `/chains/{tenantID}/{name}`: delete the chain configuration given by the {tenantID} and {name}
    * Serves an API to store a list of faucets rules their configurations (a creditor account, max balance, amount, cooldown). The API allows to dynamically update faucets configuration instead of passing them in environment variable.
        * GET `/faucets`: get the list of faucets registered
        * GET `/faucets/{uuid}`: get the faucet configuration given by the {uuid}
        * POST `/faucets`: create a new faucet for a given {tenantID}
        * PATCH `/faucets/{uuid}`: modify the faucets configuration for a given {uuid}
        * DELETE `/faucets/{uuid}`: delete the faucets configuration given by the {uuid}
    * Proxy the ethereum chains
* Add flag and environment variable:
    * `CHAIN_REGISTRY_INIT` to initialize the chain registry with some specific chains
    * `CHAIN_REGISTRY_PROVIDER_CHAINS_REFRESH_INTERVAL` to set the time interval for refreshing the list of chains from storage
    * `CHAIN_REGISTRY_URL` to set the URL to reach the chain-registry
    * `TX_LISTENER_PROVIDER_REFRESH_INTERVAL` to set the time interval for refreshing the list of chains from the chain registry
* Add rate limiter on chain registry to avoid bursty traffic on underlying chains (in particular when using Infura or Kaleido)
  
### âš  BREAKING CHANGES
#### Infrastructure
 * Merge the `tx-decoder` microservice into `tx-listener` microservice. The `tx-listener` publishes transactions directly in the `topic-tx-decoded` 
 * The `tx-listener` produces kafka messages exclusively in the topic `topic-tx-decoded` instead of the `topic-tx-decoder-{chainID}`
 * Merge the `tx-nonce` microservice into `tx-crafter` microservice. The `tx-crafter` publishes transactions directly in the `topic-tx-signer`
 * All microservices, now, have to go through the `chain-registry` microservice to communicate with any Blockchain
#### Configuration
 * Rename the default topic names from `topic-wallet-generator` and `topic-wallet-generated` to `topic-account-generator` and `topic-account-generated` respectively
 * Move environment variables `NONCE_MANAGER_TYPE` `REDIS_URL` `REDIS_LOCKTIMEOUT` from the `tx-nonce` to the `tx-crafter`
 * Remove environment variable `ETH_CLIENT_URL`, the chains urls have to be set at start-up in `CHAIN_REGISTRY_INIT` of `chain-registry` microservice or dynamically using the chain-registry API. 
 * Remove environment variables `FAUCET_CREDIT_AMOUNT`, `FAUCET_BLACKLIST`, `FAUCET_COOLDOWN_TIME`, `FAUCET_CREDITOR_ADDRESS`, the faucets configurations are stored in the chain registry using its API. 
 * Add the environment variable `CHAIN_REGISTRY_URL` to the `tx-listener`, `tx-crafter`, `tx-sender`
 * Remove environment variable `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_TX` in the `tx-listener` and `tx-decoder`. The same feature can be found in the Chain-Registry API
#### API 
 * Remove `/v1` prefix in the HTTP REST path for the `envelope-store` and the `chain-registry`
 * Instead of producing and consuming envelopes to Orchestrate, a user will produce `TxRequest` and only consume `TxResponse`

## v1.2.0 (2019-12-13)

### ðŸ†• Features

* Add new flag and environment variable `NONCE_CHECKER_MAX_RECOVERY` to configure max number of nonce recoveries to perform on a given envelope on `tx-sender`
* Nonce checker on `tx-sender` ignores envelopes with metadata entry `tx.mode` set to `raw`
* Add new flag and environment variable `DISABLE_EXTERNAL_TX` in the tx-listener to filter transactions not sent through Orchestrate

### ðŸ›  Bug fixes
* Fix connection issue when trying to connect to some Infura endpoints
* On `envelopestore`, when storing a 2nd envelope with same `tx_hash` and `chain_id` but a distinct `metadata.id` overwrites the first one

### ðŸ›  Bug fixes
* Clean logs: downgrade `OK` and `NotFound` logs to debug level in grpc server and have logger handler in debug level for tx-listener and tx-decoder
* e2e: use `CUCUMBER_STEPS_TIMEOUT` to put a timeout in cucumber steps before failing
* Makefile: add bootstrap stage to wait quorum, geth and kafka to start

### âš  BREAKING CHANGES
* **config** grpc & metrics server have been split. Default port for
  * grpc server remains 8080
  * newly rest server is 8081 
  * metrics server has changed and is now 8082

    * Transaction crafting: craft transactions and deploy contract based on the bytecode in the Contract Registry
    * Faucet: get accounts credited with Ether
    * Gas management: gas price and limit can be provided or estimated by the Ethereum client

    * External transaction signing & Key storage: store keys in HashiCorp Vault
    * External Private Transaction Signature on Besu-Orion and Quorum-Tessera.
* **Contract-Registry**: Dynamically register Smart Contract Artifacts (ABIs, bytecode & deployedBytecode) referenced by a (name, tag). Currently available in Postgres
