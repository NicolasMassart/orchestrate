Feature: Chain-Proxy Cache
  As as external developer
  I want to perform proxy calls to my chains

  Background:
    Given I have the following tenants
      | alias   | tenantID        |
      | tenant1 | {{random.uuid}} |

  Scenario: Chain registry should cache "eth_getBlockByNumber" request for same chainUUID
    Given I set the headers
      | Key           | Value                    |
      | Authorization | Bearer {{tenant1.token}} |
    When I send "POST" request to "{{global.api}}/proxy/chains/{{chain.besu1.UUID}}" with json:
      """
      {
        "jsonrpc": "2.0",
        "method": "eth_getBlockByNumber",
        "params": [
          "0x1",
          false
        ],
        "id": 1
      }
      """
    Then the response code should be 200
    And Response should have the following headers
      | X-Cache-Control | Content-Type     |
      | -               | application/json |
    Given I set the headers
      | Key           | Value                    |
